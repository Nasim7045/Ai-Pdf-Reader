AI Assistant with Speech Recognition, PDF Processing, and Text Generation
This project is an AI-powered assistant that can interact with users via speech, text input, or PDF file upload. It utilizes Google's Generative AI API for natural language processing (NLP) and leverages speech recognition and text-to-speech for a more interactive experience.

Features
Speech Input: The assistant can listen to spoken queries or commands and convert them into text using the speech recognition library.
Text Input: Users can type their questions or commands directly into the terminal.
PDF Upload: Users can upload a PDF file, from which the assistant extracts text, and then ask questions related to the content of the PDF.
Text-to-Speech: The assistant can read the response back to the user using a female voice (configurable).
AI-Powered Responses: The assistant generates natural language responses to the user’s queries using the generative AI model (Google’s Gemini 1.5).
Requirements
Python 3.x
Required libraries:
google-generativeai (for interacting with the Google Generative AI API)
speechrecognition (for speech-to-text conversion)
pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech functionality)
PyMuPDF (for extracting text from PDFs)
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install google-generativeai speechrecognition pyttsx3 PyMuPDF
Setup
API Key: You must set up your API key for Google’s Generative AI model. You can get the key by signing up for Google's cloud services.

Set your API key in an environment variable called GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY:
bash
Copy code
export GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
Speech Recognition Configuration:

The project uses the default microphone for capturing speech. Make sure your microphone is set up and functioning correctly.
PDF File Handling:

The assistant can extract text from a PDF file and answer questions based on the content. You will need to provide the file path to the PDF when prompted.
Usage
Once everything is set up, you can start the assistant by running the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python ai_assistant.py
The assistant will continuously ask whether you would like to interact using speech, text, or by uploading a PDF file. You can choose one of the following modes:

Speak: Speak your question or command aloud, and the assistant will process the speech and provide a response.
Type: Type your question or command directly, and the assistant will respond.
Upload: Upload a PDF file, and the assistant will extract the text, after which you can ask questions related to the PDF content.
Example Interactions
Speech:
User: "What is the weather today?"
Assistant: Provides a response based on the input text.
Type:
User types: "Who won the 2024 World Series?"
Assistant: Provides a response based on the input text.
PDF Upload:
User uploads a PDF file containing some article.
User: "What is the main topic of the article?"
Assistant: Extracts text from the PDF and answers the question based on the content.
